# Fine-Tuning Using GEMMA Model

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the process of fine-tuning a machine learning model using the GEMMA framework. It is designed for users who want to customize the GEMMA model for specific tasks by adapting it to their own datasets.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- GEMMA library
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the framework used in the notebook)
- Other dependencies as specified in the notebook

## Steps Included
1. **Data Preparation**: Preprocessing the dataset to be used for fine-tuning.
2. **Model Initialization**: Setting up the GEMMA model with pre-trained weights.
3. **Fine-Tuning**: Adjusting the model's parameters to better fit the new data.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the fine-tuned model on a validation set.
5. **Saving the Model**: Exporting the fine-tuned model for future use.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository or download the notebook.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` or as mentioned in the notebook.
3. Run the notebook step by step to fine-tune the GEMMA model with your dataset.
4. Adjust the parameters as needed to optimize performance.

## Notes
- Ensure that your dataset is properly formatted before running the notebook.
- The notebook is intended for users with intermediate knowledge of machine learning and neural networks.
